NeuroHack is a 3-day hackathon event with the goal to provide the space, resources, and community to learn about and work hands-on with real neuroscience data and analyses.

We will provide you with three datasets and tutorials to help you get started. Then, you will form groups to work on a common goal of your choosing. We will also propose project ideas and provide guidance and support throughout the hackathon. On the final day, groups will present their project results.

We will provide three datasets for you to work on, which we will introduce on the first day.

1. A unique electrocorticography (ECoG) [dataset]() acquired while epilepsy patients listened to a podcast.
2. An [fMRI dataset](https://github.com/snastase/narratives) with hundreds of subjects listening to a diverse set of spoken stories
3. 24 hours worth of ECoG recordings of one subject.

These datasets allow you to investigate aspects of language processing and narrative comprehension; and are accompanied by several published papers that can be used as examples or goals for replication.

## Logistical notes
* We will be using this repository's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hassonlab/neurohack/issues) page to submit your project ideas and update your progress on.
* We will be using a Slack workspace for communication (email the organizers if you haven't received an invitation).

## Schedule
